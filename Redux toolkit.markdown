# Redux Toolkit (RTK) Guide

## Overview
Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development, designed to simplify state management in JavaScript applications. It addresses common pain points in traditional Redux, such as excessive boilerplate, complex store setup, and performance issues.

## Why Redux Toolkit?
RTK was introduced to solve three main issues with traditional Redux:
- **Excessive Boilerplate**: Traditional Redux required repetitive code for action types, action creators, and reducers.
- **Complex Store Setup**: Configuring the store and middleware was cumbersome.
- **Performance Issues**: Unoptimized state updates could degrade performance.

### Key Features
- `configureStore`: Simplifies store setup with good defaults, including Redux DevTools and middleware like `redux-thunk`.
- `createSlice`: Combines actions and reducers into a single file, reducing boilerplate.
- `createAsyncThunk`: Handles asynchronous logic, such as API calls, with automatic action types for pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.
- **Immer Integration**: Enables "mutable-looking" code while maintaining immutability under the hood.
- **Redux DevTools**: Built-in support for debugging.

### Example: Counter Slice
```javascript
import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1 }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterSlice.reducer }
});
```

## Core Concepts

### `createSlice`
`createSlice` simplifies reducer and action creation by:
- Accepting a `name`, `initialState`, and `reducers` object.
- Automatically generating action creators and action types.
- Using Immer to allow "mutable" code while ensuring immutability.

#### Why Use It?
- Eliminates the need for separate `types.js` and `actions.js` files.
- Keeps related logic in one place.

#### Example: Todo Slice
```javascript
const todoSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, action) => { state.push(action.payload) },
    removeTodo: (state, action) => { return state.filter(todo => todo.id !== action.payload) }
  }
});
```

### `configureStore`
`configureStore` streamlines store creation by:
- Automatically setting up Redux DevTools.
- Including `redux-thunk` middleware by default.
- Simplifying reducer combination.

#### Example
```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import counterReducer from './counterSlice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { counter: counterReducer }
});
```

### `createAsyncThunk`
`createAsyncThunk` handles asynchronous operations, such as API calls, by:
- Generating `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected` action types.
- Integrating with `extraReducers` for side-effect handling.

#### Example: Fetch Users
```javascript
import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const fetchUsers = createAsyncThunk('users/fetch', async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/users');
  return response.json();
});

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'users',
  initialState: { users: [], status: 'idle' },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchUsers.pending, (state) => { state.status = 'loading'; })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'succeeded';
        state.users = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUsers.rejected, (state) => { state.status = 'failed'; });
  }
});
```

### Immer for Immutability
RTK uses Immer to allow "mutable-looking" state updates in reducers, while ensuring immutability behind the scenes.

#### Example
```javascript
increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 } // Looks mutable, but Immer ensures immutability
```

**Note**: Direct state mutation outside reducers (e.g., in thunks) will not work, as Immer is only active within reducers.

### `extraReducers`
`extraReducers` allows a slice to respond to actions defined elsewhere, such as async thunks or actions from other slices.

#### Example
```javascript
extraReducers: (builder) => {
  builder.addCase(fetchUsers.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
    state.list = action.payload;
  });
}
```

## Structuring a Large-Scale RTK App
Adopt a **feature-based folder structure** for scalability:
```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      authSlice.js
      authAPI.js
    users/
      usersSlice.js
      usersAPI.js
  store.js
```

Each feature includes:
- A `slice` file for state and reducers.
- An `API` file for async calls (e.g., using `createAsyncThunk`).

## RTK Query vs. `createAsyncThunk`
**RTK Query** is a powerful data-fetching and caching tool built into RTK, designed to:
- Simplify API request handling.
- Provide automatic caching and refetching.
- Manage loading states without extra code.

**When to Use RTK Query**:
- For apps with frequent API calls requiring caching and auto-refetch.
- To reduce manual async logic compared to `createAsyncThunk`.

**`createAsyncThunk`** is better for simpler async operations or when fine-grained control is needed.

## Performance Optimizations
RTK includes several performance optimizations:
- **Immer**: Efficient immutable state updates.
- **createSelector**: Memoization for derived state (via Reselect).
- **Slice-based Reducers**: Encourages code splitting for better performance.
- **RTK Query**: Caches API results to avoid redundant requests.

### Handling Large Arrays of Objects
To manage large datasets efficiently:
- **Normalize State**: Store data as `{ byId: {}, allIds: [] }`.
- **Use `createEntityAdapter`**: Simplifies CRUD operations for entities.
- **Memoize with `createSelector`**: Optimizes derived state in `useSelector`.

#### Example: Entity Adapter
```javascript
import { createSlice, createEntityAdapter } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const usersAdapter = createEntityAdapter();

const usersSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'users',
  initialState: usersAdapter.getInitialState(),
  reducers: {
    addUser: usersAdapter.addOne,
    updateUser: usersAdapter.updateOne,
    removeUser: usersAdapter.removeOne
  }
});
```

## Debugging RTK Apps
- **Redux DevTools**: Enabled by default in `configureStore` for action and state inspection.
- **Middleware**: Use `redux-logger` for action logging during development.
- **Console Logs**: Add `console.log` in reducers to track state changes.

## Handling Authentication
- Store user data and tokens in a dedicated slice.
- Use `createAsyncThunk` for login/logout API calls.
- Update state in `extraReducers` based on async outcomes.
- Protect routes by checking tokens with `useSelector`.

#### Example: Auth Slice
```javascript
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const login = createAsyncThunk('auth/login', async (credentials) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/login', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(credentials) });
  return response.json();
});

const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState: { user: null, token: null, status: 'idle' },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(login.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.user = action.payload.user;
        state.token = action.payload.token;
        state.status = 'succeeded';
      })
      .addCase(login.rejected, (state) => { state.status = 'failed'; });
  }
});
```

## Common Mistakes
- **Mutating State Outside Reducers**: Direct state mutations in thunks or other code won't work, as Immer is only active in reducers.
- **Overcomplicating Async Logic**: Use RTK Query for complex API interactions instead of manual thunks.
- **Ignoring Memoization**: Always use `createSelector` for expensive computations in `useSelector`.
